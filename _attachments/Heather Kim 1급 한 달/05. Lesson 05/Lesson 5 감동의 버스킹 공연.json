  "text": " Question. Could you think about a memorable time when you heard live music? Describe that experience in detail. When was it? Where were you? Who were you with? Who did you hear? What happened? What made that performance so memorable or special? Answer. Last fall, my family and I went to the park near our home for a small picnic. Nothing fancy. We just grabbed some snacks and headed out. But when we were about to eat on the grass, we saw a huge crowd gathered near the lake. And we could hear music coming from that direction. So of course we got curious and walked over to check it out. And guess what? It was actually a busking event hosted by a TV show and was that was on stage singing live. Her voice was so powerful and unique that we just froze. People around us were sitting recording videos and quietly enjoying the moment. The whole vibe felt so calm and kind of dreamy. Well, we ended up watching for almost two hours and totally forgot about our picnic. But honestly, I didn't mind at all because it became a very special memory for my family.",
