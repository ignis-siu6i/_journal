  "text": " Question. What do you usually do when you make an appointment with your doctor, dentist, or hair designer? Tell me about the process from beginning to end. Answer. When I make an appointment with my doctor, dentist, or hair designer, the process is pretty simple. First, I figure out when I'm free and think about the best time for the appointment. I prefer to schedule an appointment on weekdays because I don't like feeling rushed on weekends. Then I either call the office or use their online booking system. I especially like online booking because it's simple and fast. Also, I can reschedule or confirm it easily. If I call, I just tell them what I need for the appointment like a checkup or a haircut. They usually confirm the date and time directly and sometimes send me a reminder by text or email, which is really helpful. On the day of the appointment, I try to arrive a little early to settle in. There are not many people scheduled. I can start my appointment a bit earlier. So these are the things I usually do when I make appointments.",
