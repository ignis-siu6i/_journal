  "text": " Question. Can you tell me all the things you do in order to prepare to take a trip? Answer. Whenever I get ready for a trip, I follow several steps in order. To start, I choose my destination and make plans. I usually decide the details like when and where to go and what to do at the destination. And then I gather information about the destination. This includes researching famous tourist attractions, good places to eat, nice accommodations and transportation options. Next, I book my accommodations and transportation. I prefer booking online because it's the fastest way and I can confirm it easily. On the day before I leave, I pack essentials like clothes, underwear, light jackets and umbrella, some snacks and so on. I always make sure to pack toiletries. If I forget them, I might end up sending extra money during the trip. So these are the things I usually do when I prepare for a trip.",
