Question. I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You want to invite

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,760
another couple to your home for dinner. Ask your family member three or four questions

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,900
to find out when the best day and time is to have your friends come for dinner.

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,900
Answer.

Honey, do you remember Jamie? If you are okay with it, I was thinking of inviting her couple

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,560
over for dinner. What do you think? Great. So what day works best for you? I heard they're

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:41,680
free this Sunday. Would that work for you too? Then what time do you think is good? Is seven

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,840
is okay? I think it's a nice time. Not too early, not too late. And oh yeah, what should

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,160
we prepare for dinner? If we can't decide right now, I can just ask them what kind of

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,640
food they like. Alright, that's all set.
