  "text": " Question. You indicated in the survey that you take vacations internationally. Could you describe for me one of the countries you have visited? What does it look like and what are the people like there? Answer. Well, I'd like to talk about China that I've been to. It's one of our neighboring countries and it takes only two hours to get there by flight. First, China is known for its natural beauty. It has many famous mountain ranges like Himalayas where people can enjoy the beautiful scenery at any time. Also, China is a vast country with long coastlines so it offers stunning beaches and great ocean views. Exploring such natural sites is always enjoyable and refreshing. Meanwhile, China is also famous for its dynamic cities like Beijing and Shanghai. People can experience advanced technology, skyscrapers, vibrant nightlife, and unique culture in these cities. Visiting such metropolitan areas gives them a fun and lively travel experience. Like this, China is a country with natural and cultural diversity.",
