  "text": " Question. Tell me about hotels in your country. What do the hotels look like? Describe them for me in detail. Answer. Most hotels in Korea are easy to access and usually located in convenient places like subway stations or shopping areas. When you picture a typical hotel, the first thing that comes to mind is its stylish, modern look. There's always a big sign in both Korean and English and many of them have automatic doors and elevators. Parking isn't always big, but there's usually a space underground or nearby. Once you step inside, everything feels clean and well organized. There's usually a reception desk or service counter and the staff are welcoming and professional. Many places also offer self-service machines or digital systems so you don't have to wait long. Plus, there is free wifi, comfortable seating and even background music in some places, which makes the atmosphere relaxing and pleasant. So overall, I think hotels in Korea are convenient, efficient and easy to use even if it's your first time visiting.",
