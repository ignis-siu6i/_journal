# Q1: 자기소개
## Let’s start the Interview now. Tell me something about yourself.

>Hello, my name is Seunghwan Park.  
I currently work as a software developer at Samsung Electronics, where I focus on programming and solving technical problems.
I was born and raised in Ulsan, Korea, and I believe the experiences I had there shaped who I am today.  
Growing up in an industrial city taught me to think practically and focus on results.
My MBTI type is INTP, and I’m especially strong in the I, N, and P aspects.  
I prefer working independently, thinking deeply about ideas, and solving problems in flexible and creative ways.
Outside of work, I enjoy music.  
I like singing and playing the drums, and music helps me relieve stress and express myself.  
In my free time, I also enjoy playing video games, so I would describe myself as a gamer.
I’ve been married for about five years, and I’m raising a 24-month-old son.  
Becoming a parent has helped me become more responsible and see life from a different perspective.
