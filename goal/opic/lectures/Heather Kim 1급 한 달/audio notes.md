Question. Tell me about hotels in your country. What do the hotels look like? Describe them for me in detail. Answer. Most hotels in Korea are easy to access and usually located in convenient places like subway stations or shopping areas. When you picture a typical hotel, the first thing that comes to mind is its stylish, modern look. There's always a big sign in both Korean and English and many of them have automatic doors and elevators. Parking isn't always big, but there's usually a space underground or nearby. Once you step inside, everything feels clean and well organized. There's usually a reception desk or service counter and the staff are welcoming and professional. Many places also offer self-service machines or digital systems so you don't have to wait long. Plus, there is free wifi, comfortable seating and even background music in some places, which makes the atmosphere relaxing and pleasant. So overall, I think hotels in Korea are convenient, efficient and easy to use even if it's your first time visiting.

Question, you indicated in the survey that you like to go to a park. Tell me about one of your favorite parks. What does it look like? Why do you often go there rather than to other parks? Answer, the park I often go to is Central Park, which is located in a city called Suwon. I can say it is one of the biggest parks in the city, so even when it's busy, it doesn't feel crowded because there's so much space to move around. I like to go there because of the warm vibe at the place. People I see there are mostly kind and welcoming, so it's very enjoyable to spend time there. What's more, everything there is well organized. The facilities are clean and well maintained, so I can definitely feel comfortable and safe. You can also find good exercise machines, nice walking trails and cozy cafes in the park, which are convenient to use. All in all, it is a great place to visit.

Question. Tell me about a person who is healthy around you. Why do you think he or she is healthy? What does he or she do to maintain good health? Answer. Let me tell you about my best friend, Anu. We've known each other for a long time and we still talk or meet up regularly. Well, I can say he looks very healthy and energetic. He has a strong build, clear skin and always seems full of energy. Even when we hang out after work, he doesn't look tired or stressed. Also, his posture is great and he always walks with confidence which makes a strong impression. I think the main reason for this is his healthy habits. He exercises almost every day either by jogging, going to the gym or doing yoga at home. He also cares a lot about what he eats. Instead of fast food, he usually brings homemade meals with lots of vegetables and high protein. So yeah, he's someone I look up to and he always gives me positive energy.

Question, what do you normally do before you go to the movies? What do you do after watching the movie? Answer, I usually make plans with my family to catch a movie together at least once a month. Before watching a movie, we arrange the details, like when and where to go and which movie to watch. If needed, we also book our tickets in advance to avoid any hassle. Well, once we get to the theater, we grab some snacks like popcorn and drinks. After that, we head to the restroom to make sure we're all set to enjoy the movie without interruptions. And then, we enjoy the movie, which typically lasts around two hours. After the movie, we often go for dinner and chat about it. We love discussing the storyline, characters, memorable scenes, and so on. Sometimes, if we feel too tired, we just head straight home instead.

Question. Tell me about the things that you typically do when you visit another country or overseas city. Answer. When I travel overseas, I like to visit natural places and do outdoor activities. First of all, hiking is one of my favorite things to do. You know, most countries have mountains and many of them have well-maintained trails. It's a great way to explore the country's geography while staying active. I love getting some exercise while enjoying the views at the same time. Meanwhile, I also enjoy doing water activities at the beach when I travel. I can go swimming, ride a boat, or just relax by the ocean. The sea breeze and the sound of waves make it a perfect getaway from city life. Oh, and of course, having local food and shopping are must-do activities for me. Trying local food is actually one of the greatest pleasures of traveling. So, these are the things I usually do when I travel overseas.

Question. What do you usually do when you make an appointment with your doctor, dentist, or hair designer? Tell me about the process from beginning to end. Answer. When I make an appointment with my doctor, dentist, or hair designer, the process is pretty simple. First, I figure out when I'm free and think about the best time for the appointment. I prefer to schedule an appointment on weekdays because I don't like feeling rushed on weekends. Then I either call the office or use their online booking system. I especially like online booking because it's simple and fast. Also, I can reschedule or confirm it easily. If I call, I just tell them what I need for the appointment like a checkup or a haircut. They usually confirm the date and time directly and sometimes send me a reminder by text or email, which is really helpful. On the day of the appointment, I try to arrive a little early to settle in. There are not many people scheduled. I can start my appointment a bit earlier. So these are the things I usually do when I make appointments.

Question. Can you tell me all the things you do in order to prepare to take a trip? Answer. Whenever I get ready for a trip, I follow several steps in order. To start, I choose my destination and make plans. I usually decide the details like when and where to go and what to do at the destination. And then I gather information about the destination. This includes researching famous tourist attractions, good places to eat, nice accommodations and transportation options. Next, I book my accommodations and transportation. I prefer booking online because it's the fastest way and I can confirm it easily. On the day before I leave, I pack essentials like clothes, underwear, light jackets and umbrella, some snacks and so on. I always make sure to pack toiletries. If I forget them, I might end up sending extra money during the trip. So these are the things I usually do when I prepare for a trip.
