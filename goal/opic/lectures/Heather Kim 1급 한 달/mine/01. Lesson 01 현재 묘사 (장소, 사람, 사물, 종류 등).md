# [Question Type 1] 일반적 장소 묘사
## Q1. [돌발: 호텔] Tell me about hotels in your country. What do the hotels look like? Describe them for me in detail.
>[!note] Most hotels in Korea are easy to access and usually located in convenient places like subway stations or shopping areas. When you picture a typical hotel, you probably imagine a modern and stylish look. There's always a big sign in both Korean and English, and many of them have automatic doors. Parking isn't always big, but there's usually a space underground or nearby. Once you step inside, everything feels clean and well-organized. There's a reception desk or service counter, and the staff are kind and professional. These days, many hotels also offer self-service machines or digital systems, so you don't have to wait long. Plus, there is free Wi-Fi, comfortable seats, and even soft background music, which makes you feel relaxed. Overall, I think hotels in Korea are convenient, efficient and pleasant to use.
